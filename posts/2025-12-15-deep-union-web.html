&quot;deep union web&quot; is a web tool that facilitates requesting and offering generic help from nearby people that you may not even know yet. It does so by gathering your requests, offers, generic visual appearance and coordinates. Both the requests and offers are in these 7 dimensions: Preservation, Gratification, Definition, Acceptance, Expression, Reflection, Knowledge. You could consider them as increasingly subtler needs. Then users can find each other in a map, see what they match in, and if they decide to approach, they can see how others have visually described themselves and where they are (i.e. the selected user is 0.03 km North).</p><p>Feel free to use it as an icebreaker, to improve relationships, or to grow your network in a targeted manner!</p><p>Why did I do this?
I traveled by bus many times during my Masters degree and was surprised at how little people chatted in the bus. I&#39;ve always felt particularly hopeful and energetic about us humans. I keeps me going joyfully and smoothly. I noticed that people naturally had many needs and many skills or resources that they would love to share. I also noticed that many people near me spend too long pursuing some of those needs unnecesarily. So this was my effort in making other needs more explicit and to facilitate deeper conversations with people nearby.</p><p>The first really valuable uses of this kind of app may be in circumstances where people already feel some trust with those around them (retreats, company, family, friends, etc.).</p><br/><hr class="thin"/>
